[How Deep Neural Networks Work - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPWYUELwIdM&t=92s) - The first 12 to 15 minutes of this video is the basis for this project. Unfortunately, there are some errors, assumptions, and omissions that made this rather challenging to work through.
